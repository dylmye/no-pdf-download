# No PDF Download - Dylan's Fork

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MorbZ/no-pdf-download.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MorbZ/no-pdf-download)

While most PDF files can be viewed directly in the browser some PDFs will trigger a "Save as"-dialog or will be downloaded automatically. This addon views all PDF files directly in the browser. You can still save the PDF by pressing CTRL+S (or CMD+S) after viewing them.

## About this fork

The intention of this fork is to add a whitelist of domains. This acts as a better fix for the "google docs download as PDF" issue.
